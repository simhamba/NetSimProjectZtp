Title: Design considerations for project i
------     "CS551: Fall 2010: Redesigning the internet" Part 1

1. Initial RTO values: Assumed an initial RTO base value of 540000 ticks
                      for all host and added an extra value dependent
                      on source address of the host. This consideration
                      has reduced the timeouts of retransmissions in 
                      simulation
                         
                         Initial RTO = 540000 + (source Address)*1000

2. Maximum number of retransmissions: Assumed the maximum number of 
                      retransmissions needed to be 10 before the host
                      gives up trying to establish a connection due to 
                      network congestion.

3. RTT computations  : Computed RTT at the reception of ACK. RTT not updated
                      if the reception is for a retransmission.

4. Average RTT calculation: Assumed alpha=0.8 to calculate RTT. Assumed 
                      initial average RTT at the begining as 540000 ticks 
                      and when RTT is computed first, average RTT is chosen
                      to be equal to RTT.
                       
                      if i = 0
                         average RTT = 540000
                      else if i = 1
                         average RTT = RTT
                      else   
                         averate RTT(i) = alpha * average RTT(i-1) + 
                                           (1 - alpha) * RTT estimate
5. Revised RTO estimation: Computed RTO after first reception as 
                        
                      RTO = Beta * RTT (Beta = 2)
